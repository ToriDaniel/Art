    <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Tori and I've been creating art for most of my life, but I have only started selling art in the last few years. For the most part, I sell my art through my etsy shop which is linked below!</p>
        
        <p>While I don't typically do made to order or special request artwork, I'm not opposed to the idea. If there's a specific piece you want and you like my style of art, feel free to contact me and we can make a plan!</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
